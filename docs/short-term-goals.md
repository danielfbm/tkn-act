# Short-term goals

Last updated: 2026-05-03.

This document is the project's working priority list for the next few
weeks of feature work. It has two ranked tracks; both run in parallel
but track-2 items unblock track-1 items by giving us confidence that
each new feature behaves identically across backends.

For the canonical, machine-checked record of what's shipped vs. gapped
(and which fixture proves it), see `docs/feature-parity.md` — that's the
scoreboard, this file is the priority list. For "what is and isn't
tested today" see `docs/test-coverage.md`. For the long-form designs
that have already shipped see `docs/superpowers/specs/`.

## Track 1 — Tekton-upstream feature parity (most-used first)

The ranking is "how often the feature appears in real-world Tekton
catalogs and Tekton-using repos," not "how easy it is to build." Items
near the top are the ones whose absence forces the most users onto
`--cluster` today.

| # | Feature | Why it matters | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`Task.sidecars`** | Catalog Tasks rely on database / mock-service sidecars; without it, a large fraction of community Tasks won't run on `--docker`. | Out of scope in v1.2; documented in `testdata/limitations/sidecars/`. Needs design work for the docker backend (per-Task network + shared netns). Cluster mode already works. |
| 2 | **PipelineRun-level timeouts** (`spec.timeouts.{pipeline,tasks,finally}`) | Wraps the per-Task timeout we shipped in v1.2. Common in CI pipelines that need a hard wall-clock cap. | Done in v1.3 (PR for `feat: PipelineSpec.Timeouts`). Outer policy + cluster pass-through; status `timeout`, exit code 6 unchanged. |
| 3 | **`PipelineTask.matrix`** | Fan a Task across a parameter matrix (build OS × Go version, etc.). Heavily used in language-toolchain pipelines. | Not started. Engine + DAG changes are non-trivial; probably needs its own spec. |
| 4 | **`Task.stepTemplate`** | DRY for `image` / `env` shared across steps. Common in catalog Tasks. | Done in v1.4 (PR for `feat: TaskSpec.StepTemplate`). Engine-side merge before substitution; cluster pass-through verified. |
| 5 | **Load `kind: ConfigMap` / `kind: Secret` from `-f`** | Already in v1.2 as the deferred "B-3" path. Lets users pass the same YAML they would `kubectl apply` instead of `--configmap-dir`. | Done in v1.5 (PR for `feat: load ConfigMap/Secret from -f`). Loader accepts `kind: ConfigMap` / `kind: Secret` (apiVersion v1); `volumes.Store` gained a third lowest-precedence layer fed by the bundle. |
| 6 | **Pipeline results** (`Pipeline.spec.results`) | Surfaces a final value at the run level; consumers / agents read it from `run-end`. | Done in v1.5 (PR for `feat: Pipeline.spec.results`). Engine resolves after finally; cluster reads `pr.status.results`; `run-end` event carries `results`. |
| 7 | **`displayName` / `description`** on Task / Pipeline / Step | Pure UX; absent fields make pretty output less informative and AGENTS-mode output less self-describing. | Not started. Type addition + reporter change. Half a day. |
| 8 | **StepActions** (`tekton.dev/v1beta1` referenceable steps) | Newer Tekton concept (0.50+). Less frequent in catalogs today but rising. | Not started. Needs design (resolution + caching). |
| 9 | **Resolvers** (git / hub / cluster / bundles) | Largest user-impact item — most catalog usage references `taskRef` from a hub. | Not started. v1 spec explicitly punted; needs its own spec. |

## Track 2 — Backend parity (current backends first)

Today the project has two backends — `docker` (default) and `cluster`
(k3d). The v1.2 work shipped six new docker-backend features; the
`cluster-integration` workflow only exercises the `hello` fixture, so
we don't actually verify that "the same pipeline behaves the same way
on both backends."

Closing this gap before adding more backends (kind, podman) is the
priority.

| # | Item | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Cross-execute every v1.2 fixture under `--cluster`.** Same fixture descriptor, same expected outcome, run twice (once per backend). | The `cluster-integration` workflow currently runs only `hello`. Until each v1.2 fixture passes on both backends, "fidelity" is a claim, not a tested invariant. |
| 2 | **Map Tekton terminal conditions to our task statuses.** `internal/backend/cluster/run.go:watchPipelineRun` only checks `Succeeded={True,False}`. Tekton sets `Reason: PipelineRunTimeout` / `TaskRunTimeout` distinctly; we should map those to status `timeout` so the parity tests pass. | Without this mapping, a timed-out PipelineRun on cluster reports `failed`, while docker reports `timeout`. Same input, different outputs. |
| 3 | **Apply ConfigMap / Secret resources into the run namespace before submission.** When a Task uses `volumes: [configMap]`, the cluster backend currently does nothing — Tekton then fails because the named ConfigMap doesn't exist. Source the bytes from the same `volumes.Store` the docker backend uses, then `kubectl apply` an ephemeral ConfigMap into the per-run namespace. | Volumes are a v1.2 user-visible feature; without this, the `volumes/` fixture cannot pass under `--cluster`. |
| 4 | **Cluster-side `task-retry` events.** The cluster backend delegates to Tekton's retry impl; we currently emit nothing equivalent to the docker policy loop's `task-retry`. Watch TaskRun status and emit one `task-retry` per Tekton retry attempt. | Otherwise the JSON event stream differs between backends and agents have to special-case which one they're talking to. |
| 5 | **`displayName` parity.** When we add it (Track 1 #7), surface it the same way in pretty + JSON regardless of backend. | Same shape on both backends. |

After Track 2 is complete, the natural follow-ups are *new* backends
(in priority order):

1. **`--cluster-driver=kind`** alongside k3d. The v1.1 spec already
   named this as v1.2 work; the `Driver` interface exists.
2. **`podman` as a docker-compatible alternative**. Many CI runners
   ship podman by default.

Both are out of scope for the current short-term cycle.

## How this interacts with the contribution rule

Every track item ships behind the existing tests-required rule
(`AGENTS.md`): each feature lands with unit tests, a fixture under
`testdata/e2e/` if it's user-visible, and (Track 2) a cross-backend
assertion. Track 2 #1 is the unlock for treating "this feature works"
as a checkable invariant rather than an aspiration.
